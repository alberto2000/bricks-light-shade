#### A behavioural and aesthetic exploration of computationally generated artificial life forms, written in JavaScript using physi.js physics engine and three.js as a renderer

As a study of artificial, yet emergent behaviour within computationally generated "life forms", three simulations were created that run in real time and offer to observe fictional creatures "live", act and react in three different artificial habitat environments.
